            <h3>1. Identify the Appropriate Service</h3>
            <h4 class="in_title"> Scheduled 1:1 Advising </h4>
            <a href = "https://si-umich.navigate.eab.com/app/#/authentication/remote/">Scheduled 1:1 Advising Here</a>
            <p>Scheduled 1:1 appointments are for students who need more time with an advisor to answer more complex questions and situations.  Appointments are available in 30-minute increments and can be booked through Navigate360.</p>
            <h5>Examples of Discussion Topics:</h5>
            <ul>

            <h4 class="in_title">Drop In 1:1 Advising </h4>
            <a href = "https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=umsi.advising.bsi@umich.edu&ctz=America/New_York">Drop In 1:1 Advising Here</a>
            <p>Drop-in 1:1 advising appointments are an opportunity to meet with an Acodemic Adviser 1:1 in a drop-in format for 10 minutes or less. These are great to discuss academic concerns.</p>
            <h5>Examples of Discussion Topics:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>UMSI academic policies</li>
                <li>Resources available at UMSI and UM</li>
                <li>Degree requirements</li>

            <h4 class="in_title">Email</h4>
            <a href = "mailto: umsi.advising.bsi@umich.edu">Email Us Here</a>
            <p>Emailing is a great option to connect with the UMSI Academic Advising team asynchronously. Emailing is also great if you want a written copy of the conversation to refer to later on. We try to respond to emails within 24 business hours (Monday-Friday 9 AM - 5 PM, excluding holidays), but response times may vary.</p>

            <h3>2. Be Aware of Deadlines</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>If you are a student make sure that you are aware of important dates, including start and end dates, add/drop deadlines for each semester, financial aid deadlines and other deadlines that will impact you. For university deadlines and dates please refer to the UM <a href = "https://ro.umich.edu/calendars?field_calendar_type_target_id%5B1%5D=1&field_calendar_type_target_id%5B2%5D=2&field_term_target_id=178&title=">Registrar Calendar</a>.</li>
                <li>Make sure to schedule advising appointments in advance of these deadlines. It is a good idea to add in some extra days incase you have next steps you to take after your appointment.</li>
                <li>If you are reaching out via email make sure you reach out with enough time to ensure you get a response before your deadline.</li>
                <li>Dont wait till you have a problem to reach out. Get in contact before an issue becomes urgent so we can make sure you get the help you need. We are here to help if you experience difficulties, but do have to work within the university guidelines procedures, and policies  </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Prepare for Advising Appointments</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Determine your goals for our meeting. If you have topics in mind when scheduling your appointment, include them in the "meeting goal" on <a href = "https://si-umich.navigate.eab.com/app/#/authentication/remote/">Navigate360</a> this allows your advisor to be able to come prepared with specific resources and suggestions to discuss during the meeting.</li>
                <li><a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u4wb0H6tli3Bn_ZTJHWVAJePKDSeD2WfXIbD66B1nEA/edit?tab=t.0">Review your Online Degree Audit Report</a> and Unofficial Transcript in <a href = "https://wolverineaccess.umich.edu/">Wolverine Access</a>.</li>
                <li>Prepare a list of questions you would like to ask.</li>
                <li>Arrive to your appointment on time. We may be unable to extend the meeting beyond the end of your scheduled appointment.</li>
                <li>If you have a virtual appointment try to find a quiet distraction free place to take the meeting if possible. Please avoid multitasking during appointments. Do not schedule a meeting when you will be driving if you do the Adviser will ask you to reschedule when you can have the meeting safely.</li>
                <li>Joining our call from a laptop may be helpful if we need to screen share, but you are welcome to join from a smartphone.</li>
            </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="info" tabindex="0">
            <h3>4. Follow Through & Follow Up</h3>
            <ul>
               <li>Many processes at the University of Michigan are student-initiated. Your advisor may ask you to take additional steps after your advising appointment or via email, which you are responsible for completing. Some examples of this include registering for classes, applying to graduate, or initiating a late add/drop request. </li>
               <li>If your Advisor suggests that you reach out to get help or support from another staff member make sure to do this in a timely fashion.</li>
               <li>If you have additional questions after the end of your advising appointment, email your advisor or schedule a follow-up appointment. </li>
            </ul>
